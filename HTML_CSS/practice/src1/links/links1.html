            ‘Branching’ is a feature of Git that allows a project to move in multiple different directions simultaneously. There is one master branch that is always usable, but any number of new branches can be created to develop new features. Once ready, these branches can then be merged back into master. When working in a Git repository, HEAD refers to the current branch being worked on. When a different branch is ‘checked out’, the HEAD changes to indicate the new working branch. When merging a branch back into master, there is the possibility for merge conflicts to arise. These can be resolved in the same way discussed in Lecture 0.

            A ‘fork’ of a repository is an entirely separate repository which is copy of the original repository. A forked repository can be managed and modified like any other, all without affecting the original copy. Open source projects are often developed using forks. There will be one central version of the software which contributors will fork and improve on, and when they want these changes to be merged into the central repository, they submit a ‘pull request’.

            A pull request can be made to merge a branch of a repository with another branch of the same repository or even a different repository. Pull requests are a good way to get feedback on changes from collaborators on the same project. Note that forks and pull requests are both GitHub specific features.
