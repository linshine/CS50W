<!-- @media: create a media query
             I want to apply CSS but only with some specific situation, in this situation, when print.
             . is a way of specifying select everything with a particular class name.
             display is a property, here we set it to none, being not displayed.-->
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Web Page!</title>
        <style>
            @media print {
                .screen-only {
                    display: none;
                }
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
        <p class="screen-only">This paragraph won't appear when you print this page.</p>
    </body>
</html>
